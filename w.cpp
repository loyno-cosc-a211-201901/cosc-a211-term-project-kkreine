Bender -
You can't find Fry. What do you do?
Leave him behind - who cares??
Wait and search for him
    You wouldn't do that. You're Bender. You go back to the ship

Leela asks where Fry is - you were paired with him
    I think we left him behind
    Oh he's just in the ship bathroom!

You return to Earth. People keep asking where Fry is
    We left him!
    Oh he's off doing a delivery! He's been busy at work.

After a week, no one's seen Fry. He gets an award for all of his hard work you've been
reporting on. What do you do?
    Tell them you left him behind.
    Go rescue him!
